# gepa_behavior

r&d for adopting gepa style feedback to LLMs for for behavior models for robot simulation

need to figure out a lot of stuff. 

immediate next steps
1) setup sim environment (low cost)
2) map out initial research outline for converting natural language prompt optimization of gepa to behavior ~> maybe could be relevant w/ fewer shot learning after using trad behavior models on baseline task
3) get trad behavior model sim working, jack from github
4) implement initial gepa ideas i have (this is the whole project)
